Oanda (http://oanda.com) is a leading forex broker enabling you to trade over 90 currency pairs, metals, and CFDs.  

Once you sign-up, you can use Oanda though the web interface or through an API. Using the API you can make orders and find out what happened to them, as well get your balance and other account information.  Full API documentaion is here: http://developer.oanda.com/rest-live/introduction/

Using the API you can also create services such as:

* Automated trading strategies in any programming language
* Providing exchange rates for eCommerce companies
* Hedge currency risks for other companies
* Implement high frequency trading algorithms that make money while you sleep
* Build a “Chart Chat” service that combines our chart data with the StockTwits API
* Download Trading Account History to generate performance reports and trading analytics

This library is a PHP class that allows you to easily connect toOanda REST API.  (They also have a live streaming API, but this class does not work with it)  

You will need to replace your credentials in the credentials.json file for this to work.
